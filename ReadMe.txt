- sensorInfo.m is v1.0; it does not have options for curvature or stagger
- sensorInfoCurved.m is v2.0; does not have options for stagger
- sensorPositionInfo.m is the same as sensorInfoCurved.m
- sensorPositionStagger.m is the latest version and should be used
- sensorInfoRunnable.m is the code that initializes the parameters and calls the sensorPositionStagger function
- The python code is a draft of the SensorPositioningTool in SEMCAD; it probably doesn't work. The finished version is in the tool menu in SEMCAD and can be used
